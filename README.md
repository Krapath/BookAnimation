# Animated Book Repository

Welcome to the Animated Book repository! This repository contains a visually appealing animated book where each page showcases different images.
## Demo

Check out the live demo on 
[CodePen](https://codepen.io/Hunterdii/pen/zYbNJgp).

## Preview

## Embed preview 

```html
<iframe
  src="https://Krapath.github.io/BookAnimation/index.html"
  width="100%"
  height="600"
  style="border:0;"
  loading="lazy"
  title="BookAnimation preview">
</iframe>
```

> Note: The original repository `Hunterdii/BookAnimation` is archived (read-only), so I created a fork and deployed a preview. If you unarchive the original repo I can open a PR to merge these changes back.

## How it Works

The animated book is created using a combination of Markdown and HTML. Each page of the book is represented by a section with a unique set of images.
bash
 ```
